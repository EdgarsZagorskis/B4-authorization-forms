# Bootstrap 4 Authorization Forms

Vertically centered authorization forms created in Bootstrap 4 - login, reset password, sign up and two factor auth.

+ `login.html` - Login form | [Demo](http://edgarszagorskis.github.io/B4-authorization-forms/login.html)
+ `signup.html` - Sign Up form | [Demo](http://edgarszagorskis.github.io/B4-authorization-forms/signup.html)
+ `reset.html` - Reset password form | [Demo](http://edgarszagorskis.github.io/B4-authorization-forms/reset.html)
+ `2fa.html` - Two Factor Authentication form | [Demo](http://edgarszagorskis.github.io/B4-authorization-forms/2fa.html)

Basically - just link your input variables, toggle validation class for form group and fix links.  

There is only one custom css style which is used for vertical alignment. Otherwise form can be copypasted and used in whatever layout. 

These examples are build using Bootstrap v4 alpha 6 and for sugar coating added some Font Awesome icons.
